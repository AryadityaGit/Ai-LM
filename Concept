Here is a complete summary of our conversation and the final, consolidated codebase for your AI-powered, offline-first PWA reader.
This solution uses the "All-in-One Vercel" approach, which is the easiest, most efficient, and completely free method to achieve your goal.
Summary of the Project
We have designed an "Intelligent Reader" web application that serves as a powerful, modern alternative to services like Pocket.
Core Functionality: Users can paste a URL of an article. The application fetches a clean, reader-friendly version of the content, saves it to a local database within the user's browser, and makes it available for offline reading.
Offline First (PWA): The application is a Progressive Web App (PWA). This means the app itself loads instantly, even without an internet connection. The user's entire library of saved articles is stored on their device, allowing them to read anywhere, anytime.
AI-Powered Analysis: The architecture is built to integrate AI. For now, it mocks generating summaries and Q&As, but it's designed for you to easily plug in a real AI service (like OpenAI or Gemini) via a secure serverless function.
Custom Document Export: Users can choose which components (summary, full text, AI analysis) to include in a final document and export it as a professionally formatted, printable PDF in various page layouts.
Zero-Cost Architecture:
The frontend (React app) and the backend (a single serverless function) are both hosted on Vercel's free tier.
The database is the user's own browser (IndexedDB), costing nothing.
The deployment process is a simple git push.
